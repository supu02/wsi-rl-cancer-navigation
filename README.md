## 🧠 WSI-RL-Cancer-Navigation

PPO-based Reinforcement Learning for Whole-Slide Cancer Image Navigation (CAMELYON16)

This project explores reinforcement learning (RL) for intelligent patch navigation in high-resolution whole-slide images (WSIs). Instead of processing thousands of patches uniformly, a PPO agent learns to sequentially select informative regions under sparse supervision.

The objective is to evaluate whether learned navigation policies can:
	•	Improve patch efficiency
	•	Increase downstream classification quality
	•	Provide interpretable decision dynamics
	•	Scale toward foundation-model embeddings and biologically inspired exploration

## 🏥 Dataset

CAMELYON16 – Whole-slide lymph node metastasis detection benchmark.

Slides are:
	•	Tiled into non-overlapping patches
	•	Tissue-filtered via Otsu thresholding
	•	Embedded using frozen vision encoders

⸻

## 🧬 Data Pipeline

Whole-slide images are processed through tiling, tissue filtering, and frozen foundation model embedding extraction.

Pipeline stages:
	1.	Raw WSI input
	2.	Patch tiling (non-overlapping)
	3.	Tissue filtering (Otsu thresholding)
	4.	Feature extraction (frozen ViT-S/14 encoder)
	5.	Slide represented as a bag of 384-dim embeddings

## 🧠 Reinforcement Learning Formulation

Patch navigation is formulated as a sequential decision-making problem.

- **State:** Pooled slide embeddings (aggregated patch features)
- **Action:** Select next patch index (discrete)
- **Reward:** Sparse or shaped reward based on tumor detection signal
- **Objective:** Maximize successful tumor localization while minimizing navigation steps

## 🧩 PPO Agent Architecture

Navigation policy is trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with an actor–critic structure.

*Figure 2: PPO agent with shared MLP backbone and actor–critic heads for discrete patch-index selection.*

Architecture details:

- Shared MLP (2 layers, 256 units)
- Actor head: categorical policy over discrete patch indices
- Critic head: scalar value function V(s)
- Discrete action space over patch indices

## 🧪 Phase 1 — Toy RL Prototype (Paper-Inspired)

Before scaling to full-resolution CAMELYON16 slides, a simplified RL prototype was implemented to validate the navigation formulation under controlled synthetic conditions.

This phase validated:

- Navigation feasibility  
- Reward shaping behavior  
- PPO convergence stability  

### Prototype Results

| Metric        | Value  |
|--------------|--------|
| Success Rate | 82.0%  |
| Mean Return  | 0.65   |
| Mean Steps   | 4.2    |

The prototype achieved rapid convergence and demonstrated that reward shaping substantially improved navigation efficiency.  
This confirmed that reinforcement learning could meaningfully optimize patch navigation before full-resolution deployment.

## 🧪 Full Evaluation on Test Slides

| Experiment            | Success Rate | Mean Return | Mean Steps |
|-----------------------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Baseline (Sparse)     | 0.0%         | -97.7       | 997.0      |
| Prototype (Synthetic) | 82.0%        | 0.65        | 4.2        |
| Dense Reward (Final)  | **95.0%**    | **5.40**    | **120.5**  |

Dense reward shaping significantly improved convergence stability and downstream navigation efficiency.

## 🧬 Downstream Binary Cancer Classifier

After training navigation policies, selected patch embeddings were aggregated into slide-level representations.

Pipeline:
	1.	PPO agent selects informative patches
	2.	Patch embeddings aggregated
	3.	Slide-level embedding constructed
	4.	Binary classifier trained (tumor vs normal)

Preliminary findings indicate improved separability when using RL-selected patches compared to naïve or random aggregation.

This extends the project from navigation-only to an end-to-end clinical task evaluation pipeline.
