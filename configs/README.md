# Experiment Configurations

This folder will contain configuration files for training and evaluation experiments.

Planned configs:
- PPO hyperparameters (learning rate, gamma, clip ratio, entropy coefficient)
- Reward mode settings (sparse vs dense shaping)
- Patch extraction settings (tile size, stride, magnification level)
- Binary classifier settings (cancer vs non-cancer head)
- Trident-based tiling configuration
- Feature extractor backbone (e.g., UNI2-h / Virchow-2)

These configs are being cleaned and modularized before upload.
