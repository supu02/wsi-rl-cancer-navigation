# Project Notes & Design Decisions

This folder contains documentation related to:

- Dataset: CAMELYON16 whole-slide images (WSI)
- Environment design for PPO navigation
- Reward shaping strategy (sparse vs dense)
- Evaluation protocol (episode return, success rate, PPO losses)
- Binary classification head integration
- Comparison across reward modes
- Planned extensions: swarm intelligence & foveated vision

Additional notes on failure modes, debugging, and performance analysis will be added progressively.
