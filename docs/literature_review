## 📚 Literature Context

This project is grounded in recent work on reinforcement learning for weakly supervised whole-slide image (WSI) analysis.

### Primary Inspiration

1. RL-based WSI Navigation (RLogist-style approaches)
• Use reinforcement learning to navigate high-resolution WSIs
• Treat patch selection as a sequential decision-making problem
• Optimize navigation policies under sparse rewards

Relevance:
• Directly inspired the RL-based navigation prototype
• Motivated reward shaping experiments (sparse vs dense)
• Guided design of evaluation metrics (success rate, return, steps)

### Broader Literature Survey

During the literature review phase, additional works were studied:

• MuRCL (TMI 2023): RL-driven patch selection with contrastive learning  
• Dynamic Policy MIL (CVPR 2024): Adaptive instance selection under weak supervision  
• Attention-based MIL (ABMIL, CLAM)  
• Contrastive learning for pathology representation  

These works informed understanding of the field but were not directly implemented in this phase.
