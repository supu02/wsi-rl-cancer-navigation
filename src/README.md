# Source Code (In Progress)

This folder will contain:

- PPO training loop
- Custom WSI navigation environment
- Reward computation logic (sparse and dense)
- Success metric computation
- Binary classifier head for cancer prediction
- Training + evaluation scripts
- Plotting utilities for metrics

Code is currently being refactored to remove lab-specific paths and internal dependencies before being made public.
